            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

This <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Revelation</hi> in the <hi>Prophetical</hi> part thereof doth contain in it <hi>three</hi> principal Visions, <hi>viz. First,</hi> the Vision of the <hi>seven</hi> golden Candlesticks, <hi>Rev. 1.12.

<pb facs="tcp:94703:3"/> 9. Thirdly,</hi> The Vision of the new-Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and new-Earth, and the new-<hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem; Rev. 21.1, 2.</hi> This <hi>Chapter</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto the <hi>second</hi> principal Vision, <hi>to wit,</hi> the <hi>seven</hi> Trumpets, and it containes the chief Effect of the <hi>sixth</hi> Trumpet, and the <hi>second</hi> WOE to the end of the <hi>14. verse:</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the fulfilling of those <hi>Prophesies</hi> of the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidical</hi> and <hi>Monarchical</hi> KINGDOM of our LORD Jesus Christ here on Earth, <hi>(which God hath spoken by the Mouth of all his holy Prophets since the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.)</hi> When the <hi>seventh</hi> Angel shall begin to sound the <hi>third</hi> WOE Trumpet, <hi>Rev. 10.7.</hi> and the <hi>15. verse</hi> of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> and some <hi>Effects</hi> thereof, <hi>verse</hi> 16. to the End.</p>
            <p>The Reason why I speak so <hi>briefly</hi> touching the BEAST in the <hi>Exposition</hi> of the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth</hi> verse of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> is <hi>because</hi> I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <hi>(God assisting me)</hi> to treat more <hi>large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> thereof in my <hi>Exposition</hi> of the <hi>Seventeenth</hi> Chapter, <hi>vers. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</hi> which <hi>verses</hi> contain the Description of this BEAST, and
<pb facs="tcp:94703:3"/> the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the Mystery thereof; <hi>(as in its proper Place to be Expounded)</hi> and there I shall open the Mystery of Iniquity of that Man of Sin, <hi>2 Thes. 2.3.7.</hi> the POPE of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I do humbly Counsel thee <hi>(friendly Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)</hi> to Consider, that <hi>this</hi> Prophecie is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered after the Manner of <hi>other</hi> Prophesies, wherein <hi>several</hi> things are spoken in the words and language of the Prophets, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Custom of the <hi>Jews,</hi> For that <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> People, their State, Sufferings, and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies; their Temple, Worship, and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; their Kings, Priests, and Prophets were in many things <hi>Typical,</hi> and in some particulars lively Types of Christ, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Again I intreat the Judicious Reader, to observe the <hi>Allusions</hi> of the Spirit, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Temple, Altar, City, Tabernacle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and whereunto the <hi>Allusion</hi> is made, by its apt Resemblance unto some other thing, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in some sort together, and yet not the same thing but alluding unto it. <hi>Lastly,</hi> I earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estly
<pb facs="tcp:94703:4"/> desire the Reader <hi>diligently</hi> to search in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Times of the forty two Months, the <hi>1260.</hi> Daies, and the <hi>three daies and an half</hi> here mentioned, <hi>verse. 2.3.9.11.</hi> by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the most <hi>authentick</hi> Histories with the Prophesies of this Book, whereby the judicious Reader may probably know how many of these <hi>Prophetical</hi> Months, and Daies are past, and so come to understand how near the <hi>finishing</hi> Time of the Testimony of the <hi>two Prophetical</hi> Witnesses is, which must <hi>shortly</hi> come to pass, and be fulfilled.</p>
            <p>To conclude, If this Treatise shall come to the hands of the Learned, <hi>and they not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain to Read it,</hi> I do most humbly beseech some of them, <hi>to whom God hath given a greater Measure of Wisdom, Knowledge, and understanding,</hi> that they would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked hereby, to communicate the <hi>same</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly for the Glory of God, and the Benefit of his Church, and People; unto whose Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I do submit this little Treatise, to Censure it, as their Learning, Piety, and Wisdom

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> These two Witnesses are described <hi>Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> verse 4. <hi>These are the two Olive-trees and the two Candlesticks,</hi> &amp;c. By which Description it appears, that these two Witnesses are not two <hi>Individual</hi> Persons, <hi>as Moses and Elias:</hi> neither by these are intended any two Testimonies, <hi>as the Old and New-Testament:</hi> nor two
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94703:10"/> distinct Offices, <hi>as Magistrates and Ministers.</hi> For none of these <hi>Interpretations</hi> will agree with the <hi>metaphorical</hi> Description of these two Witnesses verse 4.</p>
               <p>These <hi>two</hi> Witnesses are the <hi>faithful</hi> Ministers of Christ, called <hi>two</hi> Olive-trees, verse 4. Alluding to them <hi>two</hi> Olive-Branches, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.3.11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>These are the two anointed ones, which through the two gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Pipes empty the golden oyl out of themselves.</hi> That is to say, They are the Ministers and Prophets of the Lord, who <hi>(under the Gospel)</hi> have received an <hi>unction</hi> from the holy One, Christ Jesus, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.20.27. As the Priests and Prophets did <hi>(under the Law)</hi> who were Anointed with material Oyl. <hi>Exod.</hi> 28 41. &amp; 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 19.16. And they are <hi>also</hi> the visible, true, constituted, Gospel-Churches of Christ, called <hi>here</hi> two Candlesticks, which are so Interpreted and Expounded by Christ himself <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.20. <hi>And the seven Candlesticks are the seven Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Church of God <hi>under the Law</hi> being but <hi>one,</hi> and that a National-Church, was <hi>Metaphorically</hi> described by <hi>one</hi> golden Candlestick, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.2. But the Churches of God <hi>under the Gospel,</hi> being many Congregational Churches, <hi>(as the Churches in Judea,</hi> Act. 9.31. <hi>The Churches of Galatia,</hi> 1. Cor. 16.1. <hi>and the Churches in Asia,</hi> Rev. 1.11. <hi>when they were first planted.</hi>) are Resembled by <hi>two</hi> golden Candlesticks, and by <hi>seven</hi> gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Candlesticks. Nor is my distinguishing between the Lords Ministers, his Prophets, and his Churches, unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable: for the holy Spirit of God did distinguish them, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.1. <hi>Now there were in the Church, that was at Antioch, certain Prophets and Teachers.</hi> Acts 15.4. <hi>They were received of the Church and of the Apostles and Elders.</hi> Act. 15.22. <hi>Then pleased it the Apostles, and Elders, with the whole Church,</hi> that is, <hi>all the Brethren,</hi> Act. 15.23. <hi>The Apostles and Elders, and Brethren send greeting unto the Breethren,</hi> &amp;c.<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>In this <hi>verse</hi> and the following <hi>verses</hi> to the end of the 14. verse of this Chapter, Christ revealed to his Servant <hi>John.</hi> 1. That his two Prophetical Witnesses shall be killed. 2. That their dead-Bodies shall lie unburied in the open street of the great City three daies and an half. 3. That their Adversaries shall Rejoice over them, make merry, and send gifts one to another. 4. That after three daies and an half the <hi>two</hi> slain Witnesses shall
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94703:14"/> live again, and shall Ascend up to Heaven. 5. That at the same Time of the Witnesses Ascension, the Tenth part of the great City shall fall, and 7000. Men of Name shall be slain. 6. That the Remnant will be affrighted and give glory to God. 7. That then the second Woe will be past; And the third Woe will come quickly, vers. 14. but of these 7. particulars in Order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Touching the Killing of Christ <hi>two</hi> Prophetical Witnesses, verse 7. we are to observe these particulars, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The time when the Witnesses shall be Killed, <hi>when they shall have finished their Testimony.</hi> 2. Who shall Kill them: <hi>The Beast that ascendeth out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless Pit:</hi> and 3. The Means by which He shall Kill the Witnesses. <hi>He shall make War against them, and overcome them, and Kill them.</hi> In the Exposition of this <hi>verse,</hi> and of those things, we are to observe, 1. What is the <hi>Finishing Testimony</hi> of the Witnesses of Jesus Christ? 2. Who is the <hi>Beast</hi> that shall Kill them? And 3. What this <hi>War</hi> is whereby the Witnesses shall be overcome and killed?</p>
               <p>The <hi>finishing Testimony</hi> of Christs two Prophetical Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses <hi>is the Gospel of the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ; which must be Preached in all the World for a Witness unto all Nations.</hi> Math. 24.14. <hi>And then shall the End be.</hi> Therefore, that is their finishing Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Let it be Considered, that the Prophetical Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Christ, <hi>(namely his faithful Ministers)</hi> during the 1260. Years of their Testimony have had a threefold Testimony to bear for Christ against Anti-Christ, <hi>viz. First,</hi> for the prophetical Office of Christ against the Papal Beast and the false Prophet: which Testimony the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ministers of Christ have in the daies of their prophesy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Sackcloth born by their sound Doctrine of free Grace against the false Doctrine of free will, Merit, and Condignity: also by their sound Doctrine of Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by faith in Christ, against the false Doctrine of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification by our own Works, or by our own Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And by their sound Doctrine of Evangelical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94703:15"/> against the false Doctrine of Popish Penant and Purgatory <hi>&amp;c. Then</hi> for the Priestly Office of Christ against Anti-Christ, Mystical-<hi>Babilon,</hi> the Beast, the great Whore, and the false Prophet, which Testimony the faithful Ministers of Christ have born likewise in the daies of their Prophesying in Sackcloth, touching the true and pure Worship of God in the Administration of his holy Ordinances; against the Superstitious and false Worship of the Beast, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her Priests and Jesuits in their Idolatrous Worship of God by Images, Crucifixes, <hi>Ave Maria</hi>'s, Masses, <hi>&amp;c. especially,</hi> the papal <hi>principal</hi> Idol-work, of their Breaden-God by their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious, and blasphemous Invention of Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation of the Bread and Wine into the very true and real Body and Blood of Christ by vertue of the Priests Consecration. Lastly, for the Kingly Office of Christ as King of Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.3. King of <hi>Zion,</hi> Psal. 149.1, 2. and King of Nations, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.7.10. King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.14, 15. whose Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.27. And he shall Reign for ever and ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. Now the faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Christ, have born their Testimony for Christ, that he is King of Saints, and King of <hi>Sion</hi> in these 1260. prophetical daies of their Sackcloth-Condition, their finishing Testimony, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Lord Jesus Christ is King of Nations, King of Kings, and all the Kingdoms of this world shall be the Kingdom of Christ. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.44 7.13, 14. &amp; <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. And HE shall be the only Potentate, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.15. This Finishing Testimony of the Kingdom of Christ is properly called the Testimony of Jesus, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.6, 7, 8, 9, 10. which is the Spirit of Prophesie: Many of Christ's Witnesses have been slain for the word of God, which they preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and for the Testimony which they held: <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11. &amp; 12.17. But those Witnesses of Christ who bear their Testimony for the <hi>Davidical</hi> Kingdom of Christ <hi>(to wit, That all the Kingdoms of this World shall become the Kingdom of Christ)</hi> are not yet slain, Of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94703:15"/> which <hi>Kingdom</hi> we shall Treat more fully in the Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the <hi>fifteenth verse</hi> of this <hi>Chapter.</hi>

               <p>The War, which the <hi>Beast</hi> shall make against Christs prophetical—Witnesses, whereby HE shall overcome them and kill them, is an open, visible, and publick Opposition which the Enemies of Christ, his Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, Ministers, and Saints do make against them, either by open Hostility, as the Popes and Emperours Forces did against the Protestants in <hi>Germany;</hi> or else by Publick Edicts, and Laws, as the Papists did against the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants in <hi>England</hi> in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s daies, by a violent and Bloody Persecution: which hath ever been the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Popes and Papists; Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>third,</hi> about the year 1159. and the popish Powers persecuted the <hi>Waldenses</hi> with a great and bloody Persecution; After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards about 1464. the <hi>Waldenses, the Whicklevists,</hi> the <hi>Hussites,</hi> and their followers were violently persecuted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Death, under the Name of <hi>Lollards.</hi> And at this very Time the Papists, with their Adherents, and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettors have an Hellish Plot and a bloody Design to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the Protestants, and the Protestant Religion in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and to Reestablish Popery, and Reinforce that bloody Religion by Fire and Sword.</p>
               <div type="phrase">
                  <head>And shall overcome them, and Kill them.</head>
                  <p>Some Ministers and some Members of Churches will be overcome by fear, others by flatteries; the mouths of some will be stopt by Preferment; others will be silenced by threatning, by Excommunication and by persecution, and so far overcome, as they will cease <hi>for a Time</hi> to bear their Testimony against the Beast <hi>so publickly and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously,</hi> as they did before. But that will not appease the Rage and great wrath of the Beast; for he will proceed further, and will Kill them, that still go on boldly and constantly to bear their Testimony against him, his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and his Kingdom, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.15, 16, 17. The Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the <hi>two</hi>-Witnesses doth not signifie a Corporal-death <hi>only, nor principally,</hi> for such a Death doth not <hi>fully</hi> agree to their lying unburyed in the streets of the City:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94703:16"/> nor to their Resurrection, verse, 19.11. but it is rather a <hi>Metaphorical</hi> Expression by which Jesus Christ meant and intended both a <hi>Civil</hi> and an <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Death or depravation, and deprivation of life, and livelihood: Some of them shall be deprived of all their <hi>Civil</hi> Rights, Priviledges, and Liberties: their Estates will be Confisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Proscribed, or Decimated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their Persons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, imprisoned, or banished, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>in fine</hi> all their Livings and Livelihood taken from them by the Beast, and his Instruments of Cruelty. And others of them shall be deprived of all their <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Rights, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and Liberties: yea their Love to Christ will decay, their Zeal for the Glory of God will cool, and their <hi>Spiritual</hi> vigour against Anti-Christ, and his <hi>false</hi> Doctrines, <hi>Superstitious</hi> Worship, and <hi>tyrannical</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment will faint and be ready to die.</p>
                  <p>The Darkness and blackness of the DAY of the Death of the <hi>two</hi>-Witnesses will be very great, for they will be deprived of that <hi>Spirit of Life,</hi> which they formerly had, and manifested for Christ against the Man of Sin and Son of Perdition, that Sits in the Temple of God. Some of the Witnesses, <hi>(not all of them)</hi> will fall from their first Love, loose their former zeal, and become Luke-Warm; Some of them will fall in with the grand <hi>Apostasie</hi> of these latter daies: and thereby be deprived of that vigour and Spirit of Life, which they had. And this <hi>Spiritual</hi> kind of Death is called <hi>here</hi> the <hi>Killing</hi> of the Witnesses; for as their <hi>Resurrection</hi> shall be by the Spirit of Life from God entring into them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.11. So their <hi>Death</hi> will be by being deprived of the Spirit of Life.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This great City is Mysterie, <hi>Babylon</hi> the Great, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.5. that City, which <hi>then</hi> Reigned over the Kings of the Earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.18.

               <p>The Street of the great City, is the Place where the Dead-Bodies of the <hi>two</hi> slain Witnesses lie unburied for a Time.

Nor are all the Witnesses of Christ in the Street of that great City Killed, but very many of them for there were some alive, who called to these dead witnesses, when the Spirit of Life from God, was again entred into them, saying, <hi>Come up hither</hi> &amp;c, verse 11.12.</p>
               <p>Therefore by the Street of the great City we are to understand, some part of it, and not the whole City: <hi>that is,</hi> some very eminent and famous <hi>Kingdom,</hi> where these two-Witnesses have most eminently born their <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony</hi>

                  <p>By the three Daies and an half we are to understand the last three Daies and an half of the 1260. <hi>propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Daies before expressed and expounded, even the Ending Time thereof. The knowledge of this ending Time is that which many godly and Learned Men have <hi>studiously</hi> searched, and laboured to understand, whose labours <hi>being Published,</hi> have been profitable to the Lords People, and unto me, that have read their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and have received much light and Comfort in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94703:19"/> many things: but not being fully satisfied in their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, and Expositions touching these <hi>two</hi> Witnesses and the time of their being Killed, and Raised again, I am willing to give my Opinion also and the Grounds thereof.</p>
                  <p>The 1260. Daies, verse 3. being according to the Nature of this Prophecie of the Revelation, and the Prophetical number of such Daies, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14 34. &amp; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4, 5, 6. <hi>(as hath been proved)</hi> each Day for a year, <hi>that is,</hi> 1260. years: And these <hi>three Daies and an half</hi> being the Ending Time of the <hi>two</hi> Witnesses Prophesying in Sackcloth, and the last of the 1260. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical</hi> Daies; It doth hereupon necessarily follow, and hence I conclude, 1. That the ending Time of the 1260. Daies <hi>(viz. these three Daies and a half)</hi> are not yet come, And the <hi>two</hi> Witnesses are not yet slain, <hi>for</hi> their <hi>Testimony</hi> for Christ against Anti-Christ, is not yet <hi>finished,</hi> Math. 24.14. nor is the <hi>tyrannical</hi>-Power of the Beast (which was to continue forty two Months, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.5. &amp; 11.2.) yet ended and expired. For the holy City is yet trodden under foot by the Papal-<hi>Gentiles,</hi> Rev. 11.2. and the woman (<hi>that is,—the Church</hi> of God) is <hi>Yet</hi> in the Wilderness, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.6.14. The Tyrannical Power of the Papal-Beast <hi>according to the Accompt of the best Ecclesiastick Historians,</hi> began about the year of our Lord 428. in the Reign of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Theodosius</hi> the second. When Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the third, a <hi>Roman,</hi> who at the Instance of the Empress <hi>Eudoxias,</hi> made a <hi>holy-Day</hi> for St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church. And if the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians say true, we may Conjecture that the Ending Time of the Beast's forty two Months, and of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses 1260. Daies, will be about 1688. for 1260. and 428. make 1688. or sooner. 2. Though the 1260. Daies be <hi>almost</hi> expired, the Testimony of the <hi>two</hi> Witnesses <hi>almost</hi> finished, and the Beasts <hi>Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>-Power <hi>almost</hi> come to its End, Yet the ful <hi>Period</hi> thereof will not be <hi>certainly</hi> known to the Churches, and Saints of God <hi>until</hi> these <hi>two</hi> Witnesses be Killed by

                  <p>The Means of the <hi>Mystical Resurrection</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Reviveing of the <hi>two</hi> Witnesses of Christ is <hi>here</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be <hi>the Spirit of life from God,</hi> which entred into them. vers. 11. The Manner is also here declared, <hi>And they stood upon their feet.</hi> That is, They were Raised, revived, and strengthened, imboldned, and encouraged by the <hi>Spirit of Life</hi> from God, which was powred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and entred into them to bear the same Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, against the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Anti-Christ, <hi>as formerly,</hi> and they were by the Divine power and assistance of that Spirit of life inabled to stand boldly and publickly to that Testimony of Christs Kingdom and Dominion. And this bears some <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> unto that Dispensation Prophesied of, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.5.14. <hi>O my People—I will put my Spirit in you, and ye shall live.</hi>

And therefore when God hath any eminent Work to do, or any excellent Witness to bear for Christ his Truth, Worship, or Kingdom; He doth not only Raise up his Instruments to do that Work, and Call up his Witnesses to bear their Testimony, but He doth Spirit them thereunto. <hi>As he did in former daies,</hi> The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God came upon <hi>Othoniel,</hi> Judg. 3.9, 10. upon <hi>Gideon,</hi> Judg. 6.34 upon <hi>Jepthah,</hi> Judg. 11.29. upon <hi>Sampson,</hi> Judg. 14.19. &amp; 15.14. upon <hi>David,</hi> 1. Sam. 16.13. So it shall do upon the Servants and Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Christ in that Day, when he shall Call and Raise
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94703:21"/> them up to his Work and Testimony, <hi>And he that</hi> is fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble among them at that Day shall be as <hi>David,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.8.</p>

               <p>When this <hi>second</hi> WOE (which was to happen to the Inhabiters of the Earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.13.) is past; then we are come to the Period of the <hi>second</hi> principal Vision, <hi>to wit,</hi> of the Seven Trumpets, whereof six have been Sounded by their respective Angels: And the Seventh Angel is ready to Sound, whereupon <hi>quickly</hi> followeth the third WOE. <hi>Behold the third WOE cometh,</hi>

                  <hi>quickly,</hi> that is, without any delay, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.25. without any Intermission of Time, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.7. Even as soon as the <hi>second</hi> WOE is past, behold the <hi>third</hi> WOE cometh speedily, suddenly, and quickly. This <hi>third</hi> WOE Trumpet must be Sounded by the Seventh Angel. The Fifth Angel Sounded, and <hi>one</hi> WOE past; <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.1.12. The Sixth Angel Sounded, and the <hi>second</hi> WOE past; <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.13. &amp; 11.14. And when the Seventh Angel begins to Sound there shall be Time no Longer (as Christ hath Sworn, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.5, 6, 7.) unto the <hi>Roman</hi>-Papal-Beast: for then the forty two Months of his Reigning-Power, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.1.5. will be expired; then the 1260. Prophetical-Daies of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94703:23"/> Christs <hi>Sackcloth</hi> Witnesses, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3. will be fully Ended: and then the Kingdoms of this World will <hi>successively</hi> one after another become the Kingdom of Christ, as here followeth in the 15. verse of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: And then this <hi>third</hi> WOE follows immediately, which containeth the <hi>third</hi> principal Vision, <hi>to wit,</hi> the Seven Vials of the Wrath of God, which are the seven last Plagues, that are to be poured forth upon the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>-Papal-Kingdom, Mystical-<hi>Babylon,</hi> the Beast, the Whore, and the false Prophet. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.8, 9, 10, 11. &amp; 15.1.7.16.1.10. and the 18. Chapter of this Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> vers. 2.8.21.</p>
               <p>Now although I have a very honourable esteem of those godly and Learned Expositors of this Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> who have declared their Judgments and some Reasons thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> That several of those Seven Vials have bin poured out upon Mystical-<hi>Babylon,</hi> and upon the Kingdom of the Beast; Yet notwithstanding all that they have said, I do humbly confess, that I am not of their Minds, but do rather think, <hi>That none of those seven Vials are yet poured out.</hi> And the Scripture Grounds which I humbly Submit to the Judgment of the judicious Reader for my <hi>Opinion</hi> in this Matter are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, Because</hi> the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony in Heaven is not opened: out of which Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Seven Angels must come, who are to pour out those Seven Vials of the Wrath of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.5, 6, 7. The opening of the Temple is the Restoring the Church of God on Earth unto its Apostolical Constitutions, and Primitive Purity of Worship, and Spiritual-Gifts, and unto Christs Ecclesiastical Government which is not yet done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Because</hi> the <hi>Second</hi> WOE is not yet past, and therefore the <hi>third</hi> WOE, (which are the Seven Vials of the Wrath of God as hath been fully proved) is not yet come, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.14. That the <hi>second</hi> WOE is not yet Past, is evident, for Christ's Prophetical Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94703:24"/> have not yet <hi>finished</hi> their Testimony for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ (<hi>which must be preached in all the World, for a Witness to all Nations,</hi> Math. 24.14.) they are not yet Killed, they are not yet Risen, nor Ascended, but are yet Prophesying in their Sackcloth Condition until their 1260. Prophetical Daies be ended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, Because</hi> the Seventh Angel hath not yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to Sound, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. For then, and not till then those Vials of Gods Wrath and last Plagues are to be poured forth one after another, as is Revealed in the whole 16. Chapter of this Prophesie. As the Seventh Seal ushered in the Seven Trumpets, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.1.6. So the Seventh Angel Sounding ushers in the seven Vials, and brings in the Dispensation of the Kingdom of Christ (which is not yet come) and the Opening of the Temple of God in Heaven, <hi>(which is not yet done) Rev.</hi> 11.15-19. And out of the Temple shall come the Seventh Angel having those Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven last Plagues, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.5, 6, 7. And after all these Things <hi>(then, and not till then)</hi> they are Commanded by a great voice from Heaven, Saying to them, Go your waies, and pour out the Vials of the Wrath of God upon the Earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.1, 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, Because,</hi> These <hi>last</hi> Plagues come upon My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical-<hi>Babylon</hi> in One Day, Death and Mourning, and Famin: and she shall be utterly burnt with fire, for strong is the LORD that judgeth her, Compare <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.1.16. with <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.2.5.8.21. <hi>And a Mighty An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel took up a Stone like a great Milstone, and cast it into the Sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great City Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all</hi>
                  <note n="(c)" place="margin">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note>. And shall not be found thenceforth, <hi>after that,</hi> at all. A great Milstone cast into the Sea doth not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not sometimes sink, and sometimes swim: but alwaies sinks <hi>even</hi> to the Bottom, and never swims, no never Riseth again at all; So whensoever Mystical-<hi>Babylon</hi> is once cast Down, and fallen by the pouring out those Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of Gods last Plagues upon her, she shall never, no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Rise more, but be made utterly desolate for evermore, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.8 10.21.</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:94703:24"/>
               <p>Let the Churches of Saints, the Ministers of Christ, and all that have <hi>heavenly</hi> wisdom and <hi>Spiritual</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <hi>seriously</hi> Consider under what Dispensation we are at this Time, and at this Day; We are under the Dispensation of the sixth Trumpet, and the <hi>second</hi> WOE, for <hi>the holy City is trodden under foot of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles still,</hi> Rev. 11.2. The faithful Witnesses of Christ still Prophecie in Sackcloth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3. <hi>And they are about to Finish their Testimony,</hi> Rev. 11.7. And the very next Dispensation of this <hi>second</hi> WOE Trumpet will be a Mystical War against the Witnesses of Christ by the Beast, who will overcome them and kill them, as hath been proved in the Exposition of the seventh verse; And as soon as the <hi>second</hi> WOE is past, the Seventh An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel will Sound his <hi>third</hi> WOE Trumpet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.14, 15, &amp;c.

               <p>The Effect of Christ's Execution of his Kingly Power and Government as King of Nations, <hi>whom they should fear,</hi> Jer. 10.7.10. is as here followeth, <hi>The Nations are Angry.</hi> Or as <hi>David Prophetically</hi> Expound it. <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.1, 2.3. The Heathen Rage, <hi>The Kings of the Earth,</hi> (who from the Rise to the Ruine of the Beast give their Kingdom, their Power, and Strength unto him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.13.17.) <hi>Set themselves, and the Rulers take Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel together against the Lord, and against his Anointed,</hi> Saying, <hi>Let us break their Bands asunder, and cast away their Cords from us.</hi> This Opposition of the Kings, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Councellors, will provoke the LORD to be angry against them, as here followeth, <hi>And thy Wrath is Come.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> Prophesied, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Then shall HE speak to them in his Wrath, and vex them in his hot Displeasure.</hi> Such a Dispensation was very Terrible to the Kings and Princes, and Captains, and People of the <hi>Roman-Pagan-Empire,</hi> Rev. 6.15, 16, 17. <hi>And the Kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captaines and the mighty men, and every bond-man, and every free-man, hid themselves in the denns and in the rocks of the mountains. And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: For the great day of his wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand.</hi> And so will this Day of Christ's great Indignation, when his Wrath shall Come upon the Kings, the Rulers, the Councellors, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and the People of the <hi>Roman</hi>-Papal-Empire, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94703:28"/> the Kingdoms of this World, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.15. <hi>And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.</hi> And <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.11-21.
